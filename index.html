                    <p>I don't have a formal coding background. I have a Bachelor's and a Master's in English. My first job out of college
                        was selling wedding dresses. My first job out of grad school was selling books. I don't do a ton of coding in my spare time. I was incredibly fortunate to find a job that paid me for the time they spent teaching me to code, and then placed me with a department in the that organization. Even those positions like that are rare (though they really shouldn't be), I learned that you don't need to have a formal computer science education in order to build websites. Now, I give talks at tech conferences about how my background in the liberal arts makes me a better developer. </p>
                    <p>📚 In fact, many of the core developers of Python and Django don't have a formal CS education!</p>
                    <p>A thing that happens a lot is this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>😁 A friend learns that one of their friends or colleagues is interested in getting into tech.</li>
                        <li>📱 That friend asks me if they can connect me with this person.</li>
                        <li>👋 I say, Of course! I love getting to know new people and helping them break into a new skill and possibly a new career.</li>
                        <li>💌 I write an email that contains much of the information you see on this site. This usually involves digging up the last time I wrote an email like this, so I don't have to hunt for all the links again.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So I thought, Why not make a website with all that information on it? Why not just point people to this page, and let them follow up with me if they need to after that? So here we are!</p>
                    <p>Inspiration comes from the <a href="http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/whats_next/">What's Next?</a> chapter of the Django Girls tutorial, and from the <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/resources/">PyLadies Resources</a> page. </p>
