# [williln.github.io](http://williln.github.io/)
Catchall website for things I want to share with people. 

## Why does this page exist?
I get emails from friends connecting me with their friends or acquaintances who want to learn to code, and I find myself digging through my email for the last time I responded to a similar request and basically copying and pasting. I thought... why not just have that email out there in the world? 

## How can I contribute? 

Submit a PR, please! Add resources you love (free or cheap preferred), correct my wording, add a tip I didn't think of, remove something outdated, etc. 

People who are learning right now are the best people to submit changes to this page. If you have a resource that you love, I'd love to see it. If you've never contributed to an open-source project before, I'd love to help you! The [Don't Be Afraid to Commit](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tutorial is a great place to start. 

Make sure you add yourself to the [Authors](AUTHORS.md) file in your pull request! 

## Something is broken! 

File an issue, please! I'm also using this as a way to teach myself to use Bootstrap, so I'm fiddling with buttons that show and hide things. Things that work in Chrome for me might not work the same way for you, so please let me know! 

## Special Thanks 

To everyone who has submitted pull requests, filed issues, suggested new resources, helped with design, and generally supported this project! Thanks to all the [contributors](AUTHORS.md). :sparkling_heart:
